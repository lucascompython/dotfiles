# dotfiles
Just my dotfiles

## Distro
I change distros a lot but right now on main desktop im on Arco Linux with awesomewm and on my main laptop I got ArchCraft with i3wm.

## Shell && Terminal
I mostly use fish, but im experimenting with zsh for now. I always use alacritty.

## ðŸ‘€
Im looking into FreeBsd and might sacrifice one of my laptops to be a server with it.
