Just my dotfiles

## Distro
I change distros a lot but right now on main desktop im on [Arco Linux](https://arcolinux.com) with [Awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) and on my main laptop I got [ArchCraft](https://archcraft.io) with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) when I'm with Xorg and when I'm playing with Wayland I usually go with [Hyprland](https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland). 

On my "test" laptop I am dual booting Linux with Windows using [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org) with [Regolith](https://regolith-desktop.com) Ubuntu hijacked and Windows 11. I might also experiment with [FreeBsd](https://www.freebsd.org).

## Shell && Terminal
I mostly use fish, but im experimenting with zsh and powerhsell for now. I mostly use alacritty and/or foot.
