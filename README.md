One of the coolest things about neovim is their embedded terminal emulator.  
You can open a terminal inside neovim a treat it like a normal buffer.  
This means you can navigate your whole terminal with your normal vim keybindings.  
I've costumized this behavior a bit to fit in with the zed editor keybindings I use.  
The initial config is from [here](https://github.com/xb-bx/editable-term.nvim), but I've since made some changes, to fit my workflow better.
